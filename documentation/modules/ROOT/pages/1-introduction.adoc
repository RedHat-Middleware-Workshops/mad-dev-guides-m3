If you've already completed the introduction lab in the previous module, feel free to move forward directly to the 'Build CI/CD Pipelines' lab.

A common way of speaking about migrating or modernizing workloads to the cloud has been coined as the *6 Rs framework*. This framework can be broken down as follows.

image::mod-strategies-m3.png[Modernization Strategies]

[IMPORTANT]
====
Globex's developer has already modernized the legacy application (*customers*) to the Red Hat OpenShift using https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/migration_toolkit_for_applications/6.0/html-single/introduction_to_the_migration_toolkit_for_applications/index[Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA)^] assessment and analysis tool. In the meantime, the SRE team has also completed to migrate the Oracle database from Red Hat Virtualization to OpenShift Virtualization by `module 1` and `2`.
====

This module will walk you through 2 of the phases (_Pipeline_, _GitOps_) to build advanced build and deployment capabilities as following steps:

* Build continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) based on link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/cicd/index#op-detailed-concepts[OpenShift Pipeline^] with the following key features:

** Enable to build a serverless CI/CD system that runs pipelines with all the required dependencies in isolated containers
** Allows  decentralized teams to design the automating work on microservice-based architecture
** Use standard CI/CD pipeline definitions that are easy to extend and integrate with the existing Kubernetes tools, enabling you to scale on-demand
** Enable to build images with Kubernetes tools such as Source-to-Image (S2I), Buildah, Buildpacks, and Kaniko that are portable across any Kubernetes platform
** Use the OpenShift Container Platform Developer console to create Tekton resources, view logs of pipeline runs, and manage pipelines in your OpenShift Container Platform namespaces

* Deploy the modernized applications to Red Hat OpenShift using link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/cicd/index#about-redhat-openshift-gitops_understanding-openshift-gitops[OpenShift GitOps (ArgoCD)^] with the following key features:

** Ensure that the clusters have similar states for configuration, monitoring, and storage
** Apply or revert configuration changes to multiple OpenShift Container Platform clusters
** Associate templated configuration with different environments
** Promote applications across clusters, from staging to production

== 1.1. Understand the Globex Retail System Architecture

Globex is a fictional company we will use for this workshop. The Globex system in your workshop environment consists of microservices applications that are deployed across multiple platforms such as virtual machines and a container platform as depicted below.

image::architecture_initial_m3.png[architecture_initial_m3]

Your initial state for this workshop is an environment that is spread over Legacy Virtualization and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

Your application has already been partially moved from your legacy environments to OpenShift.

The Globex retail application consists of a _Node.js_ frontend service which is getting its data via a gateway service. The gateway service is connected to three backend services: customers, orders and inventory. Each service uses its own database to store data.

The services running on OpenShift are deployed in a namespace `retail-%USERID%`. You will eventually manage these services using *OpenShift GitOps* and *Pipelines* in later modules.

[IMPORTANT]
====
**You might see the customers pods are in a failed state due to _ImagePullBackOff Error_. It will be automatically fixed when you finish the OpenShift CI/CD and GitOps sections later.**
====

All source code for the applications as well as the GitOps YAML manifests for all services are stored in a (Git-compatible) *Gitea* repository that for workshop purposes is hosted on the OpenShift cluster.

The problem right now is in the *customers* service:

* The customers service uses an old Java code base running on Apache Tomcat in a VM on Legacy Virtualization. In this module you will assess and analyze this legacy Java application to learn the best way to modernize the Java code and then deploy the application to OpenShift on top of Red Hat JBoss Web Server.
* The customers database is using an PostgreSQL database running as a VM in Legacy Virtualization. The IT Ops team at Globex want to modernize the customers database by migrating it to OpenShift containerization.

Once you have finished the all of the modules in this workshop, your deployment architecture will look like this:

== 1.2. Workshop Environment

=== 1.2.1. Confirm Your Username!

Look in the box at the top of your screen. Is your username set already? If so it will look like this:

image::alreadyset.png[alreadyset]

If your `username` is properly set, then you can move on. *If not, in the above box, enter the user ID you were assigned* like this:

image::setuser.png[setuser]

This will customize the links and copy/paste code for this workshop. If you accidentally type the wrong username, just update your username in the URL parameters (e.g., `1-introduction.html?USERID=%USERID%` )

[IMPORTANT]
====
You have to use *an unique username* (e.g. `%USERID%`) while you're running the hands-on labs. For example, you need to deploy applications to your own project (e.g. retail-%USERID%).
====

=== 1.2.2. OpenShift Cluster

Your OpenShift cluster is already configured with everything you need. Here are the details:

* `Gitea` to host the source code repositories
* `OpenShift GitOps` to manage the deployed services using a GitOps approach through ArgoCD
* `OpenShift Pipelines` to build the customer application from source code and deploy to the `retail` project using GitOps

=== 1.2.3. Visual Studio Code Server

VSCode is already deployed in the OpenShift cluster for you you to use as your IDE. This means you don't need to install and configure anything on your system. This makes it easy to change source code and configuration files in the cloned repository.

To get started, access the link:https://codeserver-codeserver-%USERID%.%SUBDOMAIN%[VS Code server instance^] and log in using the following `password`.

* Password: `{openshift-password}`

image::vscode-server-login.png[vscode-server-login]

The graphical user interface (GUI) should look like:

image::vscode.png[VSCode]

== 1.3. Log in to OpenShift

Confirm you're able to access the retail services application by accessing its frontend web application. To find the URL to access the *Frontend* application, you need to use the OpenShift command line tool (`oc`). Go to the VS Code server and Open a new terminal that already installed the _oc_ command by default.

Click on `New Terminal` in Terminal menu in the VS Code. Once a new terminal is open, run the following _oc_ command.

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
oc login -u %USERID% -p openshift https://openshift.default.svc:443
----

image::vscode-terminal.png[vscode-terminal]

[NOTE]
====
If you see a popup message about allowing copy/paste, *"See text and images copied to the clipboard"*, click on `Allow`. Then you might also see `"Use insecure connections?"` message in the terminal. In case, press `y`.
====

== 1.4 Change the Working Project

Make sure to *check out* to the right branch, `patch-postgre` that you'll go through this module today! Run the following `git` command in the VS Code terminal.

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
git checkout ocp-4.15
----

The output should be something like this.

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
branch 'ocp-4.15' set up to track 'origin/ocp-4.15'.
Switched to a new branch 'ocp-4.15'
----

== Congratulations!

You have now successfully learned about the architecture of the application and confirmed your workshop environment.

In the next step, you'll continue the modernization process by setting up configuratioun as code and using a GitOps approach to automate the application lifecycle from build to test to production.
